# WP RATINGS - A small Wordpress plugin

**WORK IN PROGRESS - usage at your own risk** :wink:

> short description tbd.


## necessary preparations
All you need is a running Wordpress instance. [Here](https://wordpress.org/download/) you could get the latest version of WP. <br>
At the time I wrote this plugin I used WP 5.3.2.


## setup
You have to clone this project to your `WordpressDocRoot/wp-content/plugins` folder. After this you have to login as admin to your backend area. <br>
Go to **Plugins** and activate our new Plugin called ***WP Ratings***.
